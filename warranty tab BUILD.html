        <h3 class="shrsubhead">Returns</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="">We will gladly accept all returns within 30 days of the date of delivery. Please reach out
            to us first with any questions or concerns regarding a possible return.</p>
        <p class="">We do not cover the cost of shipping when a part is being returned because it is no longer
            needed. Large parts must be returned via FedEx or UPS, and can be very expensive. Please be sure you
            are committed to the purchase before it is made. A 15% restocking fee may apply in certain
            situations.</p>
        <p class="">If something happened on our end that caused damage or premature wear and tear, a prepaid
            FedEx label may be provided to ship the item back at no cost to you.</p>
